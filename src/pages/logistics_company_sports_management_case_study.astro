      " A leading logistics company in the US Reach24, was facing inefficiencies      in fleet management, truck maintenance, and incident resolution. These      inefficiencies led to slower response times, higher operational costs, and      disruptions in day-to-day operations. Truck owners had to rely on      cumbersome paperwork and manual processes to manage inspections, repairs,      and driver performance. These challenges created a bottleneck in their      ability to streamline operations. ",
